## About
The goal of this tool is to allow us as developers the option to use React in our projects if we so choose. The goal of this is to just enable us to have more options available to us if we so desire. For medium/large projects, this scaffold may be a viable option as having access to modules and code reuse can hasten our development time/workflow. This current example showcases React with JavaScript. There will eventually be an example to showcase React with Typescript.
This Repo is to be used in conjunction with the bms-create-app tool.
